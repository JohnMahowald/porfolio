  <div class='description'>
    <p>My name is John. After graduating with an undergrad in <span>Philosophy & Literature</span>, I spent three years <span>traveling around the world</span>. Along the way, I taught myself how to <span>program</span>.</p>
    <p>As a developer, I am motivated by <span>working in teams</span> to tackle challenging problems. From well designed databases with <span>optimized API's</span> to using front-end MVC frameworks to build <span>beautiful websites</span>, I love solving problems across the entire stack. I am passionate about <span>pair programming</span> and focus on clear communication, both in the code I write and the people I work with.</p>
